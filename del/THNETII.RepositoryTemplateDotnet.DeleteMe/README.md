# DELETE ME

This project was created solely so that dependabot has a project that can be used to track updates to the NuGet packages included in the template.

After creating a new project from this template, this project folder and its parent directory can be deleted.

Execute the following commands from the repository root:

``` sh
dotnet sln remove del/THNETII.RepositoryTemplateDotnet.DeleteMe
git rm -rf ./del
```

Subsequently you will probably want to rename the solution file at the root level (which should be an empty solution file after removing this project).
